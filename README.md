We were not able to export our project as a jar file and have it run correctly so we
added it to this zipped folder.
-In order to run our application, simply open the Controller and then run the program.
-To navigate to the menu, simply press anywhere on the initial scene (the clock face).
-From there, you can either move to the next scene by pressing the button pertaining
to the scene or you can press the back button on the bottom of every scene.
-To change date/time settings go to main menu, then to second main menu, then to settings,
then to time settings or date settings. To increment the value press the up arrow and to decrement
press the down arrow. The values will automatically save as you change them.
-To change personal info, such as age, weight, and goals, go to main menu, then to the second main menu,
then to the personalinfo menu. From there you can chose to adjust personalinfo, gender, or goals. Like
time and date setting, you just increment/decrement with the arrows.
-To see steps taken, calories burned and how close you are to meeting your step goal for the day,
